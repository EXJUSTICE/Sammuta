Sammuta is an Android-mounted wildfire recognition system trained on an ImageNet neural network across 250 image per class.
It is built upon Google's Tensorflow Lite demo, and is completely open-source.
This demo iteration is capable of distinguishing between forests, wildfires, and sandwiches. 

As this is forked from the original TF repository, You will find the android demo itself at 
Sammuta\tensorflow\contrib\lite\java\demo\app\src\main\java\com\example\android

You will also find the training dataset and alternative tflite modifications in their respective .rar directories.

The final version of Sammuta will integrate with sensor networks and LANDSAT data to provide a multichannel early detection system.
