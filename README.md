Sammuta is an Android-mounted wildfire recognition system trained on an ImageNet neural network across 250 image per class.
It is built upon Google's Tensorflow Lite demo, and is completely open-source.
This demo iteration is capable of distinguishing between forests, wildfires, and sandwiches. 

You will find the android demo itself at 
Sammuta\tensorflow\contrib\lite\java\demo\app\src\main\java\com\example\android

The final version of Sammuta will integrate with sensor networks and LANDSAT data to provide a multichannel early detection system.
